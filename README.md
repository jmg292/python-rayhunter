# python-rayhunter

Unofficial Python bindings for EFF's [Rayhunter](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter) API.

**Note**: I am in no way associated with the EFF or with the Rayhunter project. I just think it's neat.

I build this for personal use and decided to share it. Feel free to contribute or use as you see fit.
